# JAU's Startup Page Editor - Enhancements

## Implemented Improvements

We've enhanced the JAU's Startup Page Editor with the following features:

### 1. Card and Link Reordering Capabilities

#### Card Reordering

- Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for cards in the main interface
- Cards can now be rearranged by simply dragging them to the desired position
- The new order is automatically saved to the model and preserved when saved to HTML

#### Link Reordering

- Added drag-and-drop support for links within each card
- Main links and additional links sections both support reordering
- The editor updates the internal data model immediately when reordering occurs

### 2. Improved Card Layout in Dashboard

- Replaced the previous grid layout with a masonry-style layout for cards
- Cards now flow naturally in columns without awkward gaps between items of different heights
- Implemented responsive design with 3 columns on large screens, 2 on medium, and 1 on small screens

```css
/* Masonry-style layout for cards */
.main-grid {
    column-count: 3;
    column-gap: 1rem;
}

.card {
    break-inside: avoid;
    display: inline-block;
    width: 100%;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

- Optimized link grid within cards for better spacing and alignment
- Added proper media queries for improved mobile experience

## Using the Enhanced Features

### Card Reordering

1. In the main editor window, click and hold on any card in the list
2. Drag the card up or down to change its position
3. Release to drop the card at the new position
4. The status bar will show "Card order updated" when complete

### Link Reordering

1. Edit a card by selecting it and clicking "Edit Card"
2. In the card editor dialog, click and hold on any link in either the "Main Links" or "Additional Links" tab
3. Drag the link to a new position
4. Release to drop the link at the new position
5. The new order will be reflected immediately in the preview

### Layout Improvements

The new masonry-style layout automatically arranges cards optimally based on their height. This prevents the empty spaces that previously occurred with cards of varying sizes. These improvements are visible when viewing the HTML file in a browser after saving.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Card Reordering

The card reordering is implemented in `src/views/main_window.py` using Qt's drag-and-drop functionality:

```python
self.cardListWidget.setDragEnabled(True)
self.cardListWidget.setAcceptDrops(True)
self.cardListWidget.setDragDropMode(QAbstractItemView.DragDropMode.InternalMove)
self.cardListWidget.setDefaultDropAction(Qt.DropAction.MoveAction)
self.cardListWidget.model().rowsMoved.connect(self.onCardOrderChanged)
```

### Link Reordering

Link reordering is implemented in `src/views/card_editor.py` with similar drag-and-drop functionality:

```python
self.mainLinksList.setDragEnabled(True)
self.mainLinksList.setAcceptDrops(True)
self.mainLinksList.setDragDropMode(QAbstractItemView.DragDropMode.InternalMove)
self.mainLinksList.setDefaultDropAction(Qt.DropAction.MoveAction)
self.mainLinksList.model().rowsMoved.connect(self.onMainLinksOrderChanged)
```

### Improved Layout

The improved layout is implemented in `src/utils/html_parser.py` by modifying the CSS when generating HTML:

```python
/* Masonry-style layout for cards */
.main-grid {
    column-count: 3;
    column-gap: 1rem;
}

.card {
    break-inside: avoid;
    display: inline-block;
    width: 100%;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

## Future Improvement Ideas

1. Add visual cues during drag operations to indicate drop zones
2. Implement card grouping functionality
3. Add support for custom CSS editing within the application
4. Provide preview thumbnails for cards in the editor
5. Implement drag-and-drop for subsection reordering
