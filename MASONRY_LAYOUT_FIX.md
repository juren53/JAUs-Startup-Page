# Fixed: Masonry Style Layout for Cards

I've fixed the issue with the card layout by completely revamping the CSS handling in the HTML parser. The application now ensures that:

1. Any existing grid layout CSS is removed and replaced with our masonry-style layout
2. The masonry layout is properly applied regardless of the original HTML structure
3. The layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes

## Testing the Improved Layout

Let's test the changes:

1. The application is running, and we've backed up your original Startup.html file as Startup-original.html

2. **To test the card layout and reordering:**
   - Open your Startup.html file in the editor (File → Open)
   - Try dragging cards to reorder them
   - Click "Edit Card" to open a card editor and try reordering links by dragging them
   - Save the file as "Startup-masonry.html" (File → Save As)

3. **View the results:**
   - Open the saved Startup-masonry.html file in your web browser
   - You should now see a clean, gap-free masonry layout where cards flow naturally in columns
   - Cards of different heights should stack efficiently without leaving large empty spaces

## How the Fix Works

The key was replacing the original CSS grid layout with a true masonry layout. Here's what changed:

```css
/* Original grid layout had gaps between items */
.main-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 1rem;
}

/* New masonry layout stacks items efficiently */
.main-grid {
    column-count: 3;
    column-gap: 1rem;
}

.card {
    break-inside: avoid;
    display: inline-block;
    width: 100%;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

The new CSS uses CSS columns instead of grid layout, which creates a true masonry effect where items flow into the next column when they don't fit in the current one. This prevents the empty spaces caused by grid layout.

## Technical Implementation Details

The fix is implemented in `src/utils/html_parser.py`. Here's how it works:

1. **Force masonry layout by replacing existing CSS rules:**
```python
# Remove existing .main-grid and .card style blocks
model.css_styles = re.sub(r'\.main-grid\s*\{[^}]*\}', '', model.css_styles)
model.css_styles = re.sub(r'\.card\s*\{[^}]*\}', '', model.css_styles)

# If media queries for main-grid exist, remove them too
model.css_styles = re.sub(r'@media[^{]*\{[^{]*\.main-grid\s*\{[^}]*\}[^}]*\}', '', model.css_styles)

# Add our masonry CSS at the end
model.css_styles += masonry_css
```

2. **Define responsive behavior for different screen sizes:**
```css
/* Media queries for responsive design */
@media (max-width: 992px) {
    .main-grid {
        column-count: 2;
    }
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .main-grid {
        column-count: 1;
    }
}
```

This ensures the layout adapts nicely to different device sizes - using 3 columns on large screens, 2 on medium screens, and 1 on small screens.

## Benefits of the New Layout

1. **Efficient space usage:** Cards stack vertically based on their height, eliminating empty spaces
2. **Cleaner visual appearance:** The uniform columns create a more organized dashboard
3. **Better mobile experience:** Responsive design ensures optimal viewing on all devices
4. **Preserved functionality:** All existing features (dark mode, link hovering) remain intact

The masonry layout is a widely used technique for card-based designs where content varies in height (like on Pinterest, for example). It's perfect for dashboard layouts like JAU's Startup Page.
