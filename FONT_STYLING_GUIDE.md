## Font Size Options

The following font size options are available:

| Option | Size | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Default | Browser default | Uses the default size from your CSS |
| Smaller | 0.8em | 80% of the normal size |
| Small | 0.9em | 90% of the normal size |
| Normal | 1em | Standard size |
| Large | 1.2em | 20% larger than normal |
| Larger | 1.5em | 50% larger than normal |
| Extra Large | 2em | Twice as large as normal |

## Font Color Options

You can specify colors in two formats:

1. **Hex Color Code**: `#RRGGBB` format (e.g., `#FF0000` for red)
2. **RGB Values**: `rgb(R, G, B)` format (e.g., `rgb(255, 0, 0)` for red)

The color picker button provides a visual way to select colors without needing to remember color codes.

## Live Preview

The link editor includes a live preview feature that shows how your styled link will appear. This makes it easy to experiment with different styles until you find the perfect look.

## Tips for Effective Link Styling

1. **Use consistently**: Apply similar styling to related links for visual grouping
2. **Don't overuse**: Avoid making every link a different size and color, which can create visual clutter
3. **Consider contrast**: Ensure link colors have sufficient contrast against the background
4. **Emphasize important links**: Use larger sizes for more important or frequently used links
5. **Match your theme**: Choose colors that complement your dashboard's color scheme

## Example Use Cases

- Make frequently used links larger for easier access
- Use different colors to visually group links by category
- Create a visual hierarchy with larger, more prominent links for important resources
- Highlight new or temporary links with distinct colors to draw attention

The font styling options provide endless possibilities for customizing your dashboard to match your preferences and workflow.
