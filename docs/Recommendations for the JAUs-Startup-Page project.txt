Here are some recommendations for the JAUs-Startup-Page project:

1. Implement the Future Improvements Listed in Documentation: 
•  Add visual cues during drag operations to indicate drop zones
•  Implement card grouping functionality
•  Add support for custom CSS editing within the application
•  Provide preview thumbnails for cards in the editor
•  Implement drag-and-drop for subsection reordering

2. Complete the Controllers Implementation: I noticed the controllers directory is empty except for an init.py file. Implementing proper MVC architecture by moving controller logic from views would improve code organization and maintainability.

3. Add Automated Testing: The project could benefit from a comprehensive test suite including:
•  Unit tests for the models and controllers
•  Integration tests for the PyQt6 components
•  End-to-end tests for the HTML generation

4. Create a Desktop Package: Consider packaging the application for easy installation on different platforms using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.

5. Enhance the UI:
•  Add an option to create card templates for frequently used layouts
•  Implement a dedicated theme editor beyond just light/dark mode
•  Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations

6. Improve Data Management:
•  Add import/export functionality for card configurations
•  Implement backup and restore features
•  Add synchronization options for users with multiple devices

7. Documentation Updates:
•  Create user tutorials with screenshots
•  Add a troubleshooting guide
•  Document the API for potential extensions

8. Performance Optimization:
•  Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
•  Optimize HTML parsing for large dashboards
•  Implement lazy loading for card previews

9. Security Enhancements:
•  Add validation for user inputs, particularly when parsing HTML
•  Ensure proper escaping of content when generating HTML

10. Collaboration Features:
◦  Consider adding options to share cards/layouts with other users
◦  Add version control for dashboard configurations
