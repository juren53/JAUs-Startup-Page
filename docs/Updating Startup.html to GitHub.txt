Here are some helpful tips to avoid Git push rejections in the future:

1. Always pull before you push: Make it a habit to run git pull before attempting to push changes
2. Use a consistent workflow: Consider adopting a workflow like "pull → make changes → commit → pull → push"
3. Check repository status regularly: Use git status to see if your local branch is ahead or behind the remote
4. Use fetch and merge separately for more control: If you prefer more visibility, use git fetch followed by git merge instead of git pull
5. Consider branching: For larger changes, create a feature branch to work on, then merge it back when complete
6. Enable automatic fetch in your Git client: Some GUI clients can periodically fetch changes to help you stay updated
7. Communicate with collaborators: If you're working with others on the same repository, coordinate who's working on what to minimize conflicting changes

These practices will help you maintain a smoother Git workflow and reduce the likelihood of push rejections.
