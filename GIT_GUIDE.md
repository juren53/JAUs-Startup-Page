# Git Usage Guide for The Startup Dashboard Editor

This document provides basic instructions for working with the Git repository for The Startup Dashboard Editor project.

## Basic Git Commands

### Checking Repository Status

To see the current status of your repository:

```bash
git status
```

### Viewing Commit History

To view the commit history:

git log
```

For a more compact view:

```bash

```

### Creating and Switching Branches

To create a new branch:

```bash
git branch branch-name
```

To switch to a branch:

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

Or to create and switch in one command:

```bash

```

### Making Changes

1. Edit files as needed
2. Add changes to staging:
   ```bash
   git add file-name  # Add specific files
   git add .          # Add all changes (use with caution)
   ```
3. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
   ```

### Updating Your Repository

If working with a remote repository:

git pull origin main  # Pull changes from the main branch
```

### Pushing Changes

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Often**: Make small, focused commits that address a single issue or feature
2. **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Begin with a verb and keep it concise but descriptive
3. **Use Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix
4. **Pull Before Push**: Always pull the latest changes before pushing
5. **Review Changes Before Committing**: Use `git diff` to review your changes

## Handling HTML Files

HTML files generated by the editor should generally not be committed to the repository unless they serve as examples or templates. The .gitignore file has been configured to ignore most HTML files.
